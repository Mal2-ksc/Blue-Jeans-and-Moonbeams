BJAM is a Strat-type electric guitar, sampled direct from the pickups. Ella Gitauru is a steel string acoustic (6 or 12 string, or Nashville-tuned 6-string). Both are in the SFZ (Sforzando) format.

🎸	Sampled S-type guitar with three mixable pickups and an inverted middle pickup option.

🎸	Playing range: Key 24 or 25, to 127 or as far as practical.

🎸	Controlled by keyswitches and MIDI Continuous Controllers.

🎸	Four fretting positions, affecting sample selection (both) and octave/unison change of Nashville strings (Ella G).

🎸	Reactive Tone Modeling uses a bespoke lowpass filter for every string/fret combo (CC28).

🎸	Articulations include hammer-on/pull-off, palm mute (long and short), pop, fret hand muting, and prime harmonics.

🎸	Master pitch bend range selectable from within your SFZ handler (default is still ±2). Pitch bends stack with all other tuning parameters.

🎸	Autopick feature to easily "sloppy up" or make your guitar gently weep.

🎸	Whammy bar/neck bending: "Dive Bomb"/"Neck Dive" detunes all strings unevenly. (CC31)

🎸	Bend individual notes up to ±200ȼ by pitch class, using CC36 to CC47.

🎸	Mix individual notes up to ±12 dB by pitch class, using CC48 to CC59.

🎸	Phase Delay (CC60, 61, 62) can be adjusted for all pickups/sources, and the middle pickup (BJAM) or Nashville-tuned strings (Ella G) can be inverted for extra quack.

🎸	Poly-compatible Legato by Sostenuto pedal (CC66), or less flexibly by keyswitch.

🎸	Palm mutes and Slap & Pop can be rendered less "spanky" or "chuggy" using CC71.

🎸	Harmonics can be set to leak "fundamental" into the start using CC72.

🎸	Attack time set by CC73, range is 0 to 1 second.

🎸	Useful non-note sounds such as pick rubs, swipes, fret hand mutes, and chucks.

🎸	Output is straight from the pickups, you must further shape the tone with inserts: pedals, amp, cabinet.

🎸	Detailed documentation and heavily commented SFZ files.
